# 1️⃣  Test-Driven Development
- Generate or update **pytest** tests *before* writing or refactoring 
code.
- Do **not** comment-out or delete failing asserts; fix the code. 
- Discover tests via pytest naming conventions (`test_*.py`, `*_test.py`). 
- Read feature requirements from `tests/specs/*.md` and turn each bullet 
into tests.

# 2️⃣  Object-Oriented & Pythonic style
- Follow **SOLID** principles and the “Composition over inheritance” rule. 
- Keep functions < 50 LOC and classes < 400 LOC.
- Follow **PEP 8** and format code with **Black**; don’t fight the 
formatter.
- All public methods must have type hints; enforce with **mypy --strict**. 

# 3️⃣  Security & quality gates
- Run **bandit** on each commit; block high-severity issues. 
- Enable **ruff** for linting and import-sort. 
- Keep dependencies pinned; scan with `pip-audit`.

# 4️⃣  Continuous Integration / Deployment
- Cursor should read `ci.md` for the organisation-wide rules, then 
generate a GitHub Actions workflow that:
  1. Runs **tox** with environments: {py, mypy, ruff, bandit}. 
  2. Builds a multi-stage Docker image for production. 
  3. Publishes coverage and security scores.  
- Use **matrix strategy** to test on 3.10 → 3.12. 

# 5️⃣  Docker & deployment
- Generate lean multi-stage images; final stage may use `python:slim`. 
- Add non-root user and enable `--no-cache-dir` in `pip install`.

# 6️⃣  Cost & performance for agents
- Integrate an **LLM-call cache** (e.g., `langchain.cache.InMemoryCache`) 
and key it on `(model, prompt)`. 
- Fail fast on repeated identical requests within 10 s to avoid token 
waste. 

# 7️⃣  Extra best practices (15+)
1. Pre-commit hook with `black`, `ruff`, `mypy`, `bandit`. 
2. SemVer tags and CHANGELOG adhere to Keep a Changelog.  
3. Use `pyproject.toml` for single-source build config.  
4. Pin indirect deps with `pip-tools` or `uv`.  
5. Use `__future__.annotations` for forward refs.  
6. Docstrings follow **PEP 257**.  
7. Enable `pytest --strict-markers`. 
8. Use session-scope fixtures for one-time expensive setup. 
9. Cut Docker image size < 200 MB (Slim + `--no-cache`). 
10. Run `docker scan` (Trivy or Snyk) in CI.  
11. Store secrets in GitHub Actions *encrypted secrets*, never in plain 
YAML.  
12. Bundle **mypy** cache in CI to speed up builds.  
13. Use `coverage xml` + Codecov badge.  
14. Use `cProfile` for performance regressions in tox env.  
15. Apply **prefect** or **dagster** when workflows exceed 5 steps.

Any change that violates these rules should be rejected or automatically 
fixed.
