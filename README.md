## 🎯 The Challenge

We've all been there:
- 🎲 AI interactions that work great... sometimes
- 📝 Prompts you keep rewriting from scratch
- 🤹 Juggling between different AI tools and interfaces
- 📊 No way to scale what works well

## 💡 Our Solution

A complete toolkit that helps you:

### 1. Start Simple with Text
- ✍️ Write clear instructions in plain text
- 🔄 Iterate quickly with AI assistants
- 📋 Keep track of what works
- 🎓 Learn as you go

### 2. Scale What Works
- 📦 Package successful workflows
- 🤝 Share with your team
- 📈 Improve systematically
- ✅ Validate results reliably

### 3. Power Up with Code
- 🚀 Run workflows automatically
- 🔌 Connect to your tools
- 🎮 Control every detail
- 📊 Process data at scale

## 🚀 Get Started

### 1. Copy These Files
```bash
# Get the core files
git clone https://github.com/cbardyn/ai-swiss-workflows
cd ai-swiss-workflows

# Copy what you need:
├── _ai_workflows/           # Text-based workflows
├── _ai_workflows_packages/  # Python framework for code-based workflows
└── .cursorrules             # General instructions for Cursor AI
```

### 2. Choose Your Path

#### Start with Text (Recommended)
Perfect for learning and quick wins:
1. Open any `run.md` file in `_ai_workflows/`
2. Follow the instructions
3. See results immediately

#### Jump to Code
Ready for more power:
```bash
# Install the framework
cd _ai_workflows_packages/ai_workflows
poetry install

# Try an example
cd ../../_ai_workflows/code_based/faq_analysis/_code
python run.py
```
